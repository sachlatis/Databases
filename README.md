# Databases

## Programming Project
We had to implement the database of a supermarket chain.</br> 
More specifically we had to create the ER diagram, the relational model, some basic and some more advanced queries, views, triggers etc. Moreover for the visualization of the system we create a basic User Interface using html and php. The implementation of the UI can be found in the directory UI and the implementation of the database system at the final.sql.
This project was a teamwork with Christofidi Georgia and Tzavara Nefeli-Panagiota.

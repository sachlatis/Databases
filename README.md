# Databases
This repository contains the programming project and the theory assignment for ECE NTUA course DataBases.

## Programming Project
We had to implement the database of a supermarket chain.</br> 
More specifically we had to create the ER diagram, the relational model, some basic and some more advanced queries, views, triggers etc. For the visualization of the system we created a basic User Interface using HTML and PHP. The implementation of the UI can be found in the directory UI and the implementation of the database system at the final.sql.</br>
This project was a teamwork with:
- Christofidi Georgia 
- Tzavara Nefeli-Panagiota.
